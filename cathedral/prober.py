    A budget without an ordering is a starvation bug. ``due_refreshes``

    tail. Targets are therefore ordered **most overdue first**, which is both
    fair and the order that minimises time spent outside a verdict.

    The budget is also split across two classes, because a single queue lets
    either class starve the other:

    - workers with no verified evidence yet (a first probe), and
    - workers with evidence due for refresh.

    Open mode makes this load-bearing. If new workers always won, anyone
    could enroll continuously and push already-attested miners past their
    evidence expiry, turning an admission gate into a way to zero honest
    supply. If refreshes always won, a full subnet would never admit anyone
    new. An interior share reserves both classes and unused capacity spills to
    the other, so the budget is never wasted on an empty class. The 0.0 and 1.0
    endpoints are explicit single-class-priority modes.

    Deferral is not failure. A deferred target keeps its verdict, its
    lifecycle state, and its retry counter untouched; it is simply probed on
    a later pass.

    The ordering applies even when everything fits inside the budget, because
    the pass deadline still decides who starts, and a set that fits in the

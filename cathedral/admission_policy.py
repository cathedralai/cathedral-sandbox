"""Signed, versioned admission policy governing SN39 miner enrollment.

One artifact answers every question the enrollment door asks that is not
"does this key control this request":

- **mode** — ``selected`` admits only approved operator coldkeys;
  ``all_registered`` admits any hotkey currently registered on the subnet.
- **binding** — which network and netuid the policy speaks for.
- **profiles** — which policy-registry profile ids a miner may request.
- **caps** — how many endpoints one coldkey may enroll, and how many workers
  may exist at all.

The artifact follows the trust shape the policy registry and the coldkey
allowlist already use: canonical JSON, Ed25519 over the unsigned document,
strict top-level schema, bounded encoding, validity window, publication-age
ceiling, and a sha256 digest over the canonical document for pinning.
Verification reuses the policy registry's parsing and canonicalization
primitives rather than introducing a second implementation.

What this artifact is not: it is permission to be *tested*, never proof,
admission, a score, a reward, or an earning guarantee. Nothing here reaches
the scoring or weight path. A miner listed in ``coldkeys`` that never passes
attestation stays at zero exactly like a miner that was never listed. The
strict measurement, TCB, channel-binding, and uniqueness gates are unchanged
in both modes: ``all_registered`` widens who may ask, never what is accepted.

This retained library is not used by the current direct validator.

    Rollback resistance is durable when ``state_path`` is given: the highest

    Without it the guard is in-process only and a restart forgets it.

    Pinning the artifact digest also resists rollback, but it cannot be the

"""Retained full-provenance verification for the legacy signed-vector path.

The retired thin validator fetched Cathedral's signed weight vector and
checked its signature, key identity, network/netuid, freshness, policy
identity, hotkey mapping, and burn policy before submitting. The current
direct SN39 validator does not fetch a Cathedral vector or call this module.

Full-provenance mode does not take that on trust. Given the public, signed,
content-addressed evidence for an epoch, it independently:

  * verifies the signed policy registry (Ed25519, monotonic release, validity);
  * verifies the signed score-class report against that registry
    (domain-separated report signature, report-id binding, key id, embedded
    policy_digest and verifier_digest, validity window, previous_report_id
    chain continuity);
  * verifies every referenced assurance receipt against the registry
    (canonical form, id binding, registry release+digest, validity window,
    measurement in an approved profile, receipt signature, work-unit binding);
  * recomputes each miner's share under the *versioned reward mechanism*
    deterministically from the verified work units;
  * and compares that recomputation against Cathedral's signed vector.

It NEVER treats a self-reported hardware string, a bare Cathedral assertion, or
a stale artifact as provenance. Every positive weight it would assign traces to
a verified receipt whose measurement is in the signed registry and whose work
status is "passed".

This compatibility module is transport-agnostic: callers supply
already-fetched bytes. It remains so historical artifacts can be audited.

        resolve the burn HOTKEY against the live metagraph, and a pinned
        historical integer burn uid is rejected, never required;

        confidential mass consistently;
      * the burn hotkey must never be reused as a paying miner hotkey.

    Epoch/report binding (fail-closed): agreement additionally requires the
    SIGNED ``policy_metadata.external_scores`` block to bind this exact
    verified epoch — ``latest_epoch`` equal to the evidence source_epoch and
    ``latest_complete`` true, backed by the publisher's one-report-per-epoch
    ingest immutability. ``wire_report_sha256`` (the evidence manifest's
    digest of the ingested wire report) and the signed block's

    metagraph AT the anchored block, captured by the VERIFIER's own chain
    access) and ``independent_block_hash`` (get_block_hash(block) from the
    same access). Two mutually consistent Cathedral-produced artifacts -
    the signed report and the manifest - are NOT an oracle: they could
    omit a real registered hotkey together. Equality with the report's
    signed snapshot binding is mandatory; a missing, malformed, or
    mismatched oracle fails closed before any replay.

    Every positive miner must have a controlled envelope whose bytes match
    the public manifest's ``envelope_digest``, reproduce the recorded
    evidence digest, and replay cleanly through the CANONICAL strict
    verifier path under the signed-registry policy evaluated at the
    receipt's issue time. Any gap is a hard ProvenanceError — the result is
    never silently left at receipts-only by this path.

    ``candidate_outcomes`` (the manifest's exhaustive per-candidate outcome
    map, hotkey -> verified|rejected|retired) is REQUIRED and gates the
    epoch-level claim: FULL asserts the WHOLE weight decision was
    independently proven. Every non-verified outcome is only a
    Cathedral-signed assertion in the launch artifact model, including a
    ``retired`` label for a hotkey that the independent anchored candidate
    oracle still contains. Positive replays still run and are individually
    proven, but ANY non-verified anchored candidate keeps the epoch at
    receipts_only (NOT PROVEN). A departed hotkey is absent from the
    independent candidate universe; relabelling it never proves absence.
    Malformed or inconsistent outcome evidence (unknown outcome values,
    coverage drift against the anchored snapshot, a ``verified`` outcome
    without a verified receipt or vice versa) is a hard ProvenanceError,
    never a downgrade. A zero-replay epoch also stays receipts_only, with
    the pinned verifier bytes still authenticated so fake pinned bytes
    surface here too.

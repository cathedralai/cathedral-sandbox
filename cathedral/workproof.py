"""Retained SAT replay for the legacy provenance path.

The current direct SN39 validator verifies SAT responses directly and does not
consume this published work-proof chain.

A hardware quote proves *where* work ran; it says nothing about *what* work
was done. A signed receipt asserts work digests and units, but a signer-only
assertion must never earn at FULL assurance. This module re-verifies the
published, content-addressed work artifacts end to end:

  receipt ``work.manifest_digest``  ==  sha256(canonical work-item bytes)
  receipt ``work.result_digest``    ==  sha256(canonical result bytes)
  result challenge/hotkey           ==  work item challenge / receipt subject
  the assignment                    ==  independently re-checked against
                                        every clause (exactly-once variable
                                        coverage, single sign, satisfaction)
  work units                        ==  re-derived by the validator formula
                                        (clause count for validator-derived
                                        SAT work) and equal to the receipt's
                                        signed units

The byte formats are exactly the runtime's: the ``cathedral_sat_manifest_v1``
work-item canonicalization and the work-claim evidence material
(``assigned_hotkey``/``assignment``/``challenge_id``/``satisfiable``/
``work_units``, sorted compact ASCII JSON).

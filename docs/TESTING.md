# RUNTEST — Cathedral test suite

The default suite is hardware-free and uses test doubles behind the real
`verify()` interface. The package has runtime dependencies declared in
`pyproject.toml`; `pytest` and other tooling are installed through the `dev`
extra. A green local suite proves software behavior, not live TDX hardware,
deployment, current evidence freshness, miner eligibility, or chain state.

## 1. Create the venv and install

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
cd /home/user/cathedral
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'   # installs the package + pytest
```

`-e '.[dev]'` puts `cathedral` on the path (so `scripts/` and console entry
points import cleanly), installs the runtime dependencies declared in
`pyproject.toml`, and pulls in the development tools.

## 2. Run the test suite

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

All hardware-free tests must pass. Hardware-gated coverage includes the TDX
quote round trip, the AMD SEV-SNP friend self-test, SAT lane e2e, and non-TDX
negative controls. Those cases are skipped unless `CATHEDRAL_RUN_TDX_HW=1`,
`CATHEDRAL_RUN_SNP_HW=1`, or `CATHEDRAL_RUN_TDX_NEGATIVE=1` is set on the
appropriate machine. The bounded SEV-SNP procedure is in
[`AMD_SEV_SNP_FRIEND_TEST.md`](AMD_SEV_SNP_FRIEND_TEST.md).

The plain-HTTP worker path is loopback-only test compatibility and cannot
satisfy protected work dispatch. Runtime integration tests use injected channel
clients; a real worker/runtime exercise requires the TLS-SPKI setup in
[`docs/TDX_LAUNCH.md`](docs/TDX_LAUNCH.md).

## 3. Run the SAT demo

Dispatches a SAT instance, solves it, verifies the self-certifying certificate,
and prints `PASS`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/demo_sat.py
```

Expected output (assignment varies with the canonical seed):

```
dispatched SAT instance: seed=0 n_vars=8 n_clauses=20
miner returned: satisfiable=True assignment=[...] work_units=20.0
certificate verified; lane score=20.0
PASS
```

## 4. Optional: one full mock epoch

The validator neuron composes the whole path (MOCK-attest → sybil-dedup by
`chip_id` → SAT lane → emission routing) hardware-free:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "
from cathedral.neuron.validator import epoch
from cathedral.neuron.miner import MockMiner
from cathedral.common import Policy
miners = [MockMiner('uid-1','hk-1',chip_id='chip-1'),
          MockMiner('uid-2','hk-2',chip_id='chip-2')]
r = epoch(miners, Policy(allowed_measurements={'mock-measurement-0'}))
print('admitted', r.admitted); print('weights', r.weights); print('burn', r.burn)
"
```

## Console entry points (installed by step 1)

- `cathedral` — operator CLI, including offline `customer-receipt verify`
- `cathedral-census` — the CC capability probe
- `cathedral-compute-validator` — compatibility wrapper for `cathedral runtime ...`
- `cathedral-miner` — compatibility wrapper for `cathedral worker ...`

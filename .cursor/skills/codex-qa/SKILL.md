# Codex QA work pass

This is a required step of the work pass. Do not wait for the user to ask.

## Trigger

Run this skill whenever you:

- Implement or fix code
- Change trust copy, receipts, attestation, egress, catalogs, or signed fields
- Are about to mark a PR ready for review
- Are about to say the work is done, live, or shippable

Do not skip because the Codex CLI is missing or unauthenticated. If the user explicitly cancels QA, write an INCOMPLETE report, keep the PR draft, and do not declare the work pass complete.

## Place in the work pass

1. Implement the change.
2. Add or run focused tests.
3. Commit and push a pre-testing revision when cloud-agent git rules require it.
4. Run this Codex QA pass.
5. Fix every fail-closed, honesty, contradictory-encoding, or signed-policy mismatch in the same pass, including findings labelled Medium or Low. Severity cannot convert those into residuals.
6. Re-run focused tests.
7. Update the PR with the QA verdict and residuals.
8. Only then declare the work pass complete.

## Model and effort

Default is GPT-5.6 extra high. Do not inherit `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults. Do not use GPT-5.5.

| Priority | Path | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Codex CLI (if authenticated) | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `xhigh` (`Extra High`) |
| 1 | Cursor Task | `gpt-5.6-sol-xhigh` | `xhigh` is the slug |
| 2 | Usage fallback only | `gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-sol-high` | `high` |

Treat as extra-high usage exhaustion only when the error is quota, rate limit, HTTP 429, `insufficient_quota`, or an explicit usage-cap message. Missing CLI login is not usage exhaustion.

Do not use `gpt-5.6-sol-xhigh-fast`, `gpt-5.6-luna-high`, or an unpinned CLI run as the first choice. The Task tool has no separate effort argument; the slug is the effort pin. If extra high is usage-exhausted, retry once at GPT-5.6 high and name that fallback in the QA report. If GPT-5.6 is entirely unavailable, write INCONCLUSIVE and self-audit. Do not silently drop to 5.5.

## Runner

Try in order. Do not stall on login.

1. If `npx @openai/codex` is installed and `codex doctor` reports credentials, run:

   ```sh
   npx @openai/codex review --base main \
     -c model='"gpt-5.6-sol"' \
     -c model_reasoning_effort='"xhigh"'
   ```

   Use the PR base branch if it is not `main`. If the CLI reports usage exhaustion, retry the same command with `model_reasoning_effort='"high"'` and continue. If doctor fails, credentials are missing, or the CLI exits nonzero for a non-usage reason, go to step 2 immediately. A set but invalid `OPENAI_API_KEY` is a failure, not a pass.

2. Launch a Cursor `Task` subagent with model `gpt-5.6-sol-xhigh`. That is also the path when the CLI is missing or unauthenticated. If that Task fails with usage exhaustion, retry once with model `gpt-5.6-sol-high`.

3. If both extra high and the usage fallback fail, write an INCONCLUSIVE artifact naming the blocker and still produce a structured self-audit in the same finding format. Do not claim Codex QA passed.

## What to hand the reviewer

- Exact commits and PR heads
- The contract that must be true after this change
- Files and functions that mint, map, verify, or advertise the change
- Residuals the change is not allowed to paper over

Ask it to:

- Hunt fail-open parsers and signed-versus-enforced mismatches
- Re-fetch live catalogs or endpoints before calling anything production
- Ignore unrelated CI when judging the jobs that actually exercise the change
- Refuse unpublished measurements, invented APIs, or fake solver digests

## Finding format

Use C / H / M / L. Each finding needs:

- ID and title
- File:function, or live URL
- Expected versus actual
- Suggested fix
- Disposition: `fix-now`, `document-residual`, or `out-of-scope`

PolarIS PR review comments may use P0–P3. For this work pass, treat P0/P1 as C/H.

## Disposition

Fix in this pass:

- Fail-open guest, attestor, or consumer parsers
- Signed receipt fields that do not match enforcement
- Contradictory encodings that silently pick a winner
- Docs or errors that claim a stronger guarantee than the code

Those classes are `fix-now` even when labelled Medium or Low.

Do not:

- Invent unpublished measurements or solver digests
- Close tracker issues because a draft PR exists
- Treat an unmerged mint as live
- Flip security booleans to satisfy a consumer without the corresponding enforcement
- Use GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` commits as the only PolarIS push (pull-request CI will not retrigger)

Document and leave open:

- Product residuals the user already accepted
- Features not in the live catalog
- Intentional cap or compatibility mismatches named in the PR

## Artifacts

Write a markdown report:

- Cloud agent runs: `/opt/cursor/artifacts/codex-qa-<topic>.md`
- PolarIS: also `docs/qa-audits/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/` with the report plus evidence files

Redact authorization headers, cookies, API keys, bearer tokens, raw hotkeys, and unredacted environment output. Do not commit those values.

The report must include:

- Verdict: live or not; ship-blocking or not
- Model and effort actually used, including any usage fallback
- Findings
- What was fixed in this pass versus residual
- Commands and URLs used as evidence

## Stop conditions

The work pass is not complete if:

- Any fail-closed, honesty, contradictory-encoding, or signed-policy finding remains unfixed
- QA was skipped, INCOMPLETE, or INCONCLUSIVE
- Production or live was claimed without a fresh catalog or receipt fetch

A PR may be marked ready after QA when remaining residuals are named in the PR body and are outside the claimed scope.

"""Executable cross-repo compatibility for `cathedral_assurance_receipt_v2`.

These tests verify real receipts across three repositories with the sibling
packages actually installed, because a parser extension on its own does not
create compatibility. Each leg is proved or refused with a concrete reason:

  * a receipt produced by the real `ReceiptIssuer.issue()` path with the
    optional CPU-TDX `platform` block verifies in cathedral-distill's compute
    lane through the authenticated registry adapter
    (`cathedral.receipt_bridge.AnchoredReceiptKeyResolver`). The passing case
    is issuer output, not a test-assembled document: only the malformed blocks
    below are hand-assembled, because the issuer refuses to emit them;
  * the same receipt reaches the validator seam's `verify_lane_receipt` as a
    PASS contribution;
  * the same receipt without `platform` still verifies here, and is refused by
    distill's compute lane on schema grounds (its `platform` is required), so
    the legacy behavior is explicit rather than assumed;
  * a distill-shaped receipt does NOT verify here, and the structural gaps are
    asserted directly, so "the reverse direction is a rewrite" is a checked
    fact rather than a claim about an exception;
  * unknown top-level keys, plain SEV, and TEE/class conflicts fail on both
    sides.

The default Compute test environment may skip this module when the sibling
packages are absent. The dedicated cross-repository CI job sets
``CATHEDRAL_REQUIRED_CROSS_REPO_CONTRACT=1`` and imports every required module
directly, so a missing package is a hard collection failure rather than a
passing skip. That job installs fixed local worktrees and is the required
compatibility signal.

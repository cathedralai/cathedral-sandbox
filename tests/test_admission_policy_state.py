"""Durable config_version high-water mark.

The in-process guard resets on restart, so a superseded but validly signed
policy could be replayed to re-open a mode or restore a revoked coldkey. The
obvious alternative, pinning the artifact digest, cannot be the production
answer on its own: the staleness ceiling forces a re-sign, a re-sign changes
issued_at and therefore the digest, so a required pin makes the service
refuse every enrollment one ceiling later until someone restarts it.

Covers:
  1. The high-water mark survives a new provider instance (a restart).
  2. A damaged or unreadable state file fails closed, not open.
  3. A state write that cannot be completed refuses the advance.
  4. Without a state path the guard stays in-process, as before.

"""Contract: the frozen launch cardinality is actually frozen.

`cathedral/launch_limits.py` calls itself a "Frozen SN94 Intel TDX launch
cardinality contract" and says its limits are "shared by the score producer,
evidence exporter, and independent verifier". Nothing froze them. Four of the
six could be changed with the whole suite still green:

    MAX_LAUNCH_CANDIDATES               SURVIVED
    MAX_LAUNCH_VERIFIED_CANDIDATES      caught
    MAX_LAUNCH_HOTKEY_BYTES             SURVIVED
    MAX_LAUNCH_WIRE_REPORT_BYTES        SURVIVED
    MAX_LAUNCH_SCORE_REPORT_BYTES       caught
    MAX_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_BASE_URI_BYTES  SURVIVED

The two that were caught are caught incidentally, by tests that use the symbol
as a bound rather than assert its value, so they only object to some changes.

Why a literal pin rather than a derived one. Several of these are *exact*
ceilings belonging to a system this repository does not control: the subnet
publisher's authenticated intake, and the public evidence verifier's fetch
limit. A test that re-derives a ceiling from the symbol agrees with itself no
matter what the symbol says. Only a literal can disagree.

The failure a drift produces is expensive and late. Raise the wire ceiling and
the producer will freeze and post a report the publisher then refuses: the
epoch is already committed and immutable, `retry-publish` resends the same
bytes forever, and the only exit is `abandon-complete`. The work is done, paid
for in compute, and unpublishable. Lowering one strands reports the other side
would have accepted.

So changing any of these is a deliberate cross-system decision. This file makes
it fail here first, next to the reason, rather than in production against a
service that is entitled to say no.
